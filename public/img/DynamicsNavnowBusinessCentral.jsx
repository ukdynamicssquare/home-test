                The first option for existing Microsoft Dynamics NAV customers
                to upgrade to Business Central On-premises is by getting two
                named Business Central users for every concurrent NAV user
                purchased before October 1, 2018. Thus, a starter pack of
                Business Central On-Premises will get you six essentials users.
                Similarly, you can get two essential users with a full user
                non-extended pack. While the starter pack with extended
                capability can give you six premium users, the full user pack
                with extended capability will give you two premium users.

                Microsoft is also offering NAV customers the option to purchase
                Business Central licenses on a per user per month basis. It
                involves lesser initial investment and gives you more
                flexibility and scalability as you can increase the number of
                licenses as your business grows. You can further lower your
                expenses by hosting the licenses on Microsoft Azure. Of course,
                it will involve Azure-hosting cost but it is usually cheaper
                than running an on-premises server or outsourcing to a local
                partner.

                You also have the option of deploying Business Central as a

                you get licenses and hosting included in one monthly
                subscription of SaaS deployments. However, Business Central SaaS
                has some limitations in terms of scope for customisation, for
                which you can utilise Extensions 2.0 to enhance your solution.

                When planning to upgrade from Microsoft Dynamics NAV to Business
                Central ensure that you are up to date with your Business Ready
                Enhancement Plan (BREP) payments because only that will make you
                eligible for the above offers. If not, a simple calculation can
                help you know how much you owe - add 3% penalty to 16% of the
                original license price per annum. This calculation will help you
                decide between back paying your BREP and re-enrolling as a new
                customer.
              </p>

                <b>For instance:</b>

                Back pay + re-enrolment fee + future year

                License List price is £10,000. Lapsed 420 days
                <br />
                £10,000 * (16% + 3%)/365 = £5.21 per day
                <br />
                £5.21 * 420 days + (16% * £10,000) = £3,788.20
