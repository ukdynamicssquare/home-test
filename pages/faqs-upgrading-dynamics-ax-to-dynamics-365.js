                Upgrading from Dynamics AX 2009 and AX 2012 to Dynamics 365 for
                Operations brings significant new features and capabilities.
                Operations is available in three deployment scenarios and three
                types of user. This page aims to clarify the upgrade process and
                options.

                        D365O deployment is extremely flexible. There are three
                        deployment options: cloud-hosted, on-premises (“local
                        business data”) and hybrid (“cloud + edge”). It is
                        possible to start on one scenario and move to another,
                        in either direction. There are different subscription
                        and infrastructure costs for each scenario.

                        Generally, the older your version of Microsoft Dynamics
                        AX, the more iterations it has undergone, and the more
                        likely the customisations will have to be re-developed
                        for Dynamics 365 for Operations. Custom coding is now
                        done via extensions instead of over-layering. Microsoft
                        has made it a priority to provide code upgrade tools to
                        simplify the migration of custom code.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        The code upgrade tools in Lifecycle Services (LCS)
                        assist in evaluating the effort for upgrade before
                        making the commitment, automatically migrate code to the
                        current version, and also streamline the process by
                        providing automated merging and documenting where manual
                        merging needs to be performed.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        As Dynamics AX 2012 R3 has a similar data structure to
                        D365 there will be less refactoring required than older
                        versions; and some customisations may now be covered by
                        standard functionality and will not have to be migrated
                        or re-coded.

                        As with custom code, the upgrade process of reports and
                        BI content is a three-stage approach: analyse, execute
                        and validate. Microsoft's upgrade tools may migrate some
                        SSRS reports and BI cubes from AX 2012 R3, however,
                        content from older versions will need more
                        re-development.
