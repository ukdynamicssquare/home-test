              <p>
                Dynamics Square cookie policy page will explain all about why
                and how cookies are used. What is the actual need for cookies
                and what sort of information does it contain? How to prevent
                cookies from being stored and what happens when you allow or
                disallow cookies. So, we are going to uncover all such things
                through our cookies page.
              </p>
              <h3>What Are cookies?</h3>
              <p>
                Cookies are small size files that are used to improve user
                experience. When you visit any professional site, you are asked
                whether to allow or disallow cookies. These cookies are
                downloaded and saved to your system to function adequately and
                to serve personalized information to the seeker or user.
              </p>
              <h3>How do Cookies work?</h3>
              <p>
                Cookies are created to improve users' experience when a user
                visits the site. These cookies are downloaded in users/ system,
                thereby, whenever the user browses the same site, will
                experience improved functionality considering what he/she had
                browsed while visiting the site last time.
              </p>
              <p>
                When you permit us to allow cookies in your system, cookies help
                us to understand your browsing preferences or purpose of
                visiting our website so that whenever you revisit our website,
                we can serve a better or personalized experience to you.
              </p>
              <h3>How we use Cookies?</h3>
              <p>
                Dynamics Square uses cookies for a number of reasons but yes,
                the main purpose of leveraging cookies is just to serve the
                optimal experience whenever any visitor comes to our site. Since
                every user seeks different information, and we try to serve the
                matching experience. Although, you can disable the cookies if
                you are aware of what cookies you need to disable.
              </p>
              <p>
                In most cases, users are not aware, thereby, they may disable
                the functionality they are seeking for. Hence, it's better to
                not to chase the cookies or leave them the way they are. Yet,
                you always have the option to disable the cookies in your
                system.
              </p>
              <h3>Enabling & Disabling Cookies</h3>
              <p>
                Often you get notified of cookies while browsing over the
                internet. You are always asked whether to accept the cookies or
                simply deny them. So, it's totally up to you whether you want to
                accept the cookies or not. Even after accepting the cookies
                once, you can disable them from your system.
              </p>
              <p>
                But remember, declining cookies may interrupt your use of the
                site as you will interrupt certain functionality and interfere
                with a bit of navigation which could affect your purpose of
                visiting the site. So, if you really want to enjoy the smoother
                flow of any website, it would be better not to disable the
                cookies.
              </p>
              <h3>How we make use of Cookies?</h3>
              <h4>Essential Cookies</h4>

                intervene even the basic navigation of the site. The information
                you provide through submitting the contact page, feedback, etc.,
                helps to remember user details for future correspondence (if
                required).

                These cookies enable us to save your record when you visit our
                site. This could include a number of pages, exact pages, and
                links that you follow while visiting our website. We utilize all
