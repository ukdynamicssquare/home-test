            <p>
              Azure IoT Hub is a highly secured and scalable managed service
              hosted on the cloud. It acts as a bidirectional messaging hub
              to ensure reliable communication between IoT applications
              and connected devices.It allows connecting any device and
              a multitude of devices along with their solutions can be connected
              seamlessly to track device performance and demonstrate the same on
              your custom-built app dashboard.

                  <li>
                    To streamline your enterprise practices, the IoT hub can
                    seamlessly be configured or integrated with your other Azure

                  <li>
                    Every IoT hub comes with an identity registry that stores
                    and keeps device information along with permitted modules.

                  <li>
                    For secured authentication between IoT hub and devices, it
                    allows you whether to choose SAS token-based authentication
                    or X.509 certificate authentication.

                      flexibility to transmit up to a limit of 8000 messages/per
                      day. If your requirement crosses this limit, you need to
                      go with a paid plan. If you have any sort of queries in

                      Depending on your unique requirement, your requirement may
                      go different. So, let's drive a difference to understand
                      your requirement.

                      <br />
                      When you plan to deploy an IoT environment, you can start
                      with IoT Hub Basic tier initially.

                      <br />
                      Since IoT Hub comes with the property of bidirectional
                      communication and if you want to deploy your IoT hub with
                      foundational security embedded with per-device
                      authentication along with optimal device support and
                      seamless upgrade opportunity, IoT Hub Standard could be a
                      smarter choice for you. This plan also comprises device
                      management and Azure IoT Edge support.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Azure Event Hubs could be a suitable deal for those
                      dealing and willing to manage big-data or web data
                      ingestion.
