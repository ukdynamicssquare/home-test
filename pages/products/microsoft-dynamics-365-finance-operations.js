            Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations Licensing & Pricing
            </h2>
            <p>Currently, there is no pricing or licencing available for Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations as a whole. Because Microsoft has already separated this single solution into two powerful ERPs. So, Dynamics 365 Finance and Dynamics 365 Supply Chain licencing are a bit different and available in different terms. However, you will be required to purchase at least 20 user licences to avail yourself of any of the solutions. </p>
            <p>Dynamics 365 Finance is a powerful ERP solution specifically designed to monitor and supercharge complex financial processes in real-time. Based on your requirements, you can access this ERP using four licencing options: Team Members, Operations Activity, Finance, and Finance Premium.</p>
            <p>Dynamics 365 Supply Chain comes with asset management and intelligent order management capacity and is available in three licencing options: Team Members, Operations Activity, and SCM. </p>
