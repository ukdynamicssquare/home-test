                  <h3>Modern Functionalities for Modern Businesses</h3>
                  <p>Salesforce CRM has a good grip on the market, but <Link href="/products/microsoft-dynamics-crm/"><a>Dynamics 365 CRM</a></Link> understands businesses better. With time, both solutions have launched different modules to manage the specific functionality of the business. Based on requirements, businesses can choose the module they require to manage customers. And, picking the desired module will reduce the implementation and operational costs.</p>
                  <p>In general, Salesforce comes with three major modules to manage the CRM functionality of the business:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Salesforce Sales Cloud</li>
                    <li>Salesforce Service Cloud</li>
                    <li>Salesforce Marketing Cloud</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                </div>
              </div>
              <div className="col-lg-12">
              <p>These modules will manage the sales, customer, and marketing needs of the business.</p>
                  <p>When compared to Salesforce, Dynamics 365 CRM comes with more modules, which means it comes with advanced capabilities to manage a specific portion of the business. These modules are:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><Link href="/products/microsoft-dynamics-365-sales/"><a>Dynamics 365 for Sales</a></Link></li>
                    <li>Dynamics 365 for Customer Insights (formerly D365 for Marketing)</li>
                    <li><Link href="/products/microsoft-dynamics-365-customer-service/"><a>Dynamics 365 for Customer Service</a></Link></li>

                  </ul>
                  <p>Microsoft has recently updated Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM to <Link href="/products/dynamics-365-customer-engagement/"><a>Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement</a></Link>. It’s not just the name change; it’s a revolution towards modernization and digitalization of businesses.</p>

                  <h3>Simplified Integrations to Power Up Customer Journey</h3>
                  <p>Businesses are becoming more complex, and so are their processes. To reduce such complexities, businesses have to work with different add-ons and solutions altogether. Working with different tools and centralising the data is a daunting task and requires a lot of extra resources.</p>
                 <p>However, integrating the secondary solutions with the primary ones can automate a lot of processes and simplify the operations of not only CRM but the entire business. Salesforce allows integration, but you will need to put resources and effort into integrating a particular solution. For example, if you want to integrate Microsoft Outlook, you will need a developer or coder to establish the connection.</p>
                 <p>However, with Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM, you can integrate Outlook with just a click and fetch the data for professional communication directly into the Dynamics 365 dashboard.</p>
                 <p>Microsoft has a plethora of business solutions available in the Dynamics 365 ecosystem. You can choose the desired solution and integrate it with other Microsoft solutions instantly.</p>
